# vscode-tintin-formatter
This visual studio code add-on will help you format your files with the .tin extension.
These are basically tintin++ codes.

Install the extension in normal VS Code:

- Open VS Code.
- Go to the Extensions view [ctrl+shift+x], then select "Install from VSIX...".
- Open the .vsix file and install it.

Or just simply run this:
code --install-extension tintin-formatter-1.0.0.vsix
